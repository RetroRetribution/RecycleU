  <h1>About Us</h1>

  <p class="text">
    RecycleU is a sustainability-focused web platform designed to encourage responsible recycling habits through engagement, transparency, and rewards. Our goal is to make recycling more accessible, motivating, and impactful by helping users understand how small everyday actions contribute to a healthier environment.

    The platform combines environmental awareness with a points-based incentive system. By recycling items such as plastic bottles, paper, or glass, users can earn points that can later be redeemed for eco-friendly rewards. This approach transforms recycling from a passive responsibility into an active and rewarding experience.
    
    RecycleU was created with the belief that sustainable behavior should be simple, measurable, and motivating. By providing clear feedback on recycling efforts and offering tangible incentives, the platform aims to support long-term habit formation rather than short-term participation.
    
    As a student-developed project, RecycleU represents an exploration of how digital systems can be used to promote environmental responsibility at a community level. It demonstrates how technology, when thoughtfully designed, can support behavioral change and contribute to more sustainable urban lifestyles.
